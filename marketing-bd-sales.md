#### Quick Intro to npm

#### Qualifications

We are looking for someone with a passion for building a technical community from the ground up. We’re a start-up — flexibility and a willingness to pitch in where needed are a plus.

#### Quick Intro to npm On-Site

Over 1,000 companies have expressed interest in npm On-Site, with over 100 new companies beginning 30 day trials each month. Price points for npm On-Site range between $300 for a POC to over $100K for a site license.

We expect a high-volume, high throughput sales process that focuses on helping customers understand the product, guiding them through setting up a trial and coordinating answers to technical questions during the their POCs.

For large customers, the position will involve building and maintaining executive level relationships across customer organizations and business units, and navigating procurement processes typical of of $100K+ purchases.

You will be comfortable with a disciplined approach to sales, including automated sales tools and maintaining an accurate and up to date information within our CRM. We are a very data driven company and focus on pipeline progress and metrics around promptness of sales responses and customer satisfaction.

#### Qualifications

We are looking for someone with 5+ years of demonstrated successful Enterprise Software or SaaS sales experience.  Ideally, you will also have startup experience and enough technical knowledge to understand what developers do and how npm can help them.

Over 1,000 companies have expressed interest in npm On-Site, with over 100 new companies beginning 30 day trials each month. Price points for npm Enterprise range between $300 for a POC to well over $100K for a site license.

#### The npm Sales Development Representative Position

Each month, hundreds of people express interest in a trial of npm On-Site.   Your job will be to reach out to each of these folks and try to determine if our Account Execs should follow-up with them as a potential large client.  Typical things you might ask include:

*	“What are you trying to accomplish with this trial?”
*	“Would it be useful for us to schedule time with technical support to guide you through set-up and configuration?
*	“Can we help you get your fellow developers setup to use npm On-Site?”
*	“How many developers do you think might end up using this solution?”

Based on the results of your quick discussion, you’ll refer some folks over to our Account Execs.   Others will be marked as self-service who are best supported by our customer success process.   

You will have quotas for the number of folks you follow-up with each month, with initial goals requiring 25 to 50 calls a day.   Over time, that goal will change and could grow.

## About npm, Inc.
npm is the package manager for JavaScript. The team is small, and growing quickly. If you join us, you will see the company grow through numerous changes, and take a bunch of different roles.

npm’s mission is to take Open Source development to entirely new places. When everyone else is adding force, we work to reduce friction.

npm is not a typical product, and we are not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. We believe that the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We aim for a sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision. Compassion is our strategy.

Our offices are in downtown Oakland, California. We offer very competitive salaries, meaningful equity, and generous health, dental and vision benefits. We love it when you represent us at conferences.
