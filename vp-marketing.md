We’d like to hear from you.

##VP of Marketing

The npm service supports a massive community of over 2 million developers who use our platform to share and reuse packages of Javascript code.  Our users depend on npm to help them build solutions for thousands of the largest companies in the world.   Best of all, npm is growing exponentially.   

npm, Inc is looking for an experienced senior leader to help the company build a high-velocity, low-touch marketing and self-service sales engine that solves problems for millions of developers who rely on npm to get their jobs done.

The VP of Marketing will build and lead a team that is responsible for all company marketing and developer relations.   This is a dream job for a data-driven, brand-oriented marketer who enjoys the process of turning passionate users into paying customers.

We are looking for a rising talent who is interested in expanding their role to include ecommerce and online marketing, brand advertising, web and viral strategies, public relations and social media, channel marketing, tradeshows and events.

We are looking for someone who is excited about using an approach that follows a continual cycle of hypothesis development, lots of running tests and experiments, measuring results, implementing the new “best practices” and then repeating the entire process to drive further optimization.

Most importantly, we want someone who, like us, loves empowering developers, fostering a robust, supportive community and has a strong sense of what marketing and sales processes work well with software engineers.   

You’ll be responsible for overseeing Developer Relations and managing an evangelist organization that focuses on creating content that teaches rather than convinces, that is useful and that efficiently adds value for developers trying to get something done.

You’ll also work closely with the Revenue team to help them drive both self-service sales and build a more conventional inside-sales pipeline.   To bolster our self-service sales, marketing will be called upon to help optimize an automated funnel management system that includes sophisticated drip campaigns, metrics driven integration of customer success teams and developer centric content.

What will make this fun is that npm already has 2 million passionate users.   The task is simply to help our existing users adopt npm’s new solutions.   This is a job where your actions will immediately have an impact on millions of real customers.



##About npm, Inc.
npm is the package manager for JavaScript. The team is small, and growing quickly. If you join us, you will see the company grow through numerous changes, and take a bunch of different roles.

npm’s mission is to take Open Source development to entirely new places. When everyone else is adding force, we work to reduce friction.

npm is not a typical product, and we are not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. We believe that the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We aim for a sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision. Compassion is our strategy.

Our offices are in downtown Oakland, California. We offer very competitive salaries, meaningful equity, and generous health, dental and vision benefits. We love it when you represent us at conferences.
