# About npm

npm is lots of things.

* npm is the package manager for JavaScript.  It was created in 2009 as an [open source project](https://github.com/npm/npm) to help JavaScript developers easily share packaged modules of code.
* The npm Registry is a public collection of packages of open-source code for Node.js, [front-end web apps](http://www.ember-cli.com/), [mobile apps](http://cordova.apache.org/), [robots](https://tessel.io/), [routers](https://linerate.f5.com/), and countless other needs of the JavaScript community.
* _npm_ is the command line client that allows developers to install and publish those packages.
* npm, Inc. is the company that hosts and maintains all of the above.

## About npm, Inc.

npm, Inc. is a company co-founded in 2014 by npm’s creator, [Isaac Z. Schlueter](https://github.com/isaacs), and [Laurie Voss](https://github.com/seldo).

npm, Inc. is dedicated to the long term success of the JavaScript community, which includes the success of the open-source Node.js and npm projects.

At npm, Inc. we do three things to support this goal:

1. Run the open source npm Registry as a free service.
2. Build tools and operate services that support securely using packages in a private or enterprise context.
3. Build innovative new tools and services to reduce developer friction.

npm’s mission is to take Open Source development to entirely new places. When everyone else is adding force, we work to reduce friction.

Our technology has been embraced by millions of developers worldwide for client- and server-side applications as diverse as IoT, mobile development, financial services, and aerospace. More than 30,000 companies, including the BBC, DocuSign, IBM, SiriusXM, Slack, and Visa, rely on npm’s products and services to reduce developer friction and build amazing things.

npm is not a typical product, and we are not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. We believe that __the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another.__

We aim for a sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision. Compassion is our strategy.

Our offices are in Oakland, California.
