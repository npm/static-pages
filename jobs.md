## frontend engineer, www team

[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) is growing quickly, with a million unique visitors every month and over 5MM page views. Having given it a totally new look and overhauled the backend over the last year, we launched [private modules](https://www.npmjs.com/private-modules) in April.

Now we have a ton of ambitious plans for it, including team-management features,  [curation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#collections) and [programmatic validation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#ecosystems) of packages, better stats, and significantly better search. We also have our [npm Enterprise](https://www.npmjs.com/enterprise) product, which needs a web experience all of its own.

All of this adds up to a ton of website that needs to get built, and this role will emphasize front-end skills: robust client-side JavaScript, beautiful CSS, and elegant markup. Our site has only a limited amount of "rich" functionality right now, and you'll be responsible for greatly expanding and improving that, with a lot of say in how it gets built.

We don't need you to be familiar with any specific client-side JS or CSS framework, and in fact we'd prefer the kind of pragmatic, experienced developer who has a bunch of tools in their belt and can thoughtfully select the right one for the job.

The npm website is [open source](https://github.com/npm/newww), so all your work on the main site will be, too.

We have a strong preference for candidates who are local to our offices in Oakland, CA, but we are accepting exceptional remote candidates who have a proven track record of successful remote work.

## Enterprise Engineer

When companies need an on-premise npm registry, [npm
Enterprise](http://npm.im/enterprise) is the solution we offer them.
npm Enterprise runs the exact same codebase as the public registry
running at <https://registry.npmjs.org>.

Since we had to build most of the parts in order to facilitate running
the public registry, we started selling npm Enterprise back in
mid-2014.  Despite not having been a top company priority, it's been
picked up by a few of the biggest companies in the world, and reflects
a very significant portion of npm, Inc.'s revenue.

Our goal is for this product to eventually be absolutely trivial for
our customers to buy, install, administer, and manage, as part of
npm's mission of reducing friction at all stages of JavaScript
software developent.

As npm's Enterprise Engineer, you'll work on the last mile of making
npm Enterprise the product that our customers need.  You'll also be
working with customers directly to figure out what those needs are,
and helping them to be successful.

You'll be working closely with the Registry Team (since the codebases
overlap almost entirely), and also assisting with the sales and
onboarding process in order to get a feel for what matters most to our
users.

Your work will have a significant impact in the company's bottom line,
while improving the lives of our users in an immediate and tangible
way.  There is a ton of low-hanging fruit, and plenty of interesting
challenges beyond.

We're looking for someone who combines technical ability with empathy
and a genuine interest in helping customers.  We don't want you
solving the same problems over and over again; we want you improving
the product so that common problems go away.  A background in
consulting or technical support is useful, but not required.

We prefer candidates who are local to our offices in downtown Oakland,
California, but are open to remote work for the right candidate.  We
cannot currently sponsor new work visas other than TN-1s, and we can
transfer existing H-1Bs.

##npm Enterprise — Account Executive

This is a unique opportunity to have a very big impact at an early stage, well funded, fast growing startup that already has tremendous traction.

#### Quick Intro to npm

2.6 Million JavaScript developers depend on npm to make them more productive by helping them share and reuse code.   npm is used by Yahoo!, Google, PayPal, Uber, Twitter, IBM, Adobe, Amazon and thousands of other companies.

A great way to learn about our product and how it fits in the universe of developer tools is to dig through the Bloomberg article [What is Code](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/), by Paul Ford 

#### Quick Intro to npm Enterprise

npm, Inc recently added npm Enterprise - an on-premise software product that provides all the benefits of npm with the security and control enterprise users demand. Over 1,000 companies have expressed interest in npm Enterprise, with over 100 new companies beginning 30 day trials each month. Price points for npm Enterprise range between $300 for a POC to over $100K for a site license.

This is a quota carrying position, but because our customers are developers, it will require a very soft sales approach.   We expect a high-volume, high throughput sales process that focuses on helping customers understand the product, guiding them through setting up a trial and coordinating answers to technical questions during the their POCs.

For large customers, the position will involve building and maintaining executive level relationships across customer organizations and business units, and navigating procurement processes typical of of $100K+ purchases.

You will be comfortable with a disciplined approach to sales, including automated sales tools and maintaining an accurate and up to date information within our CRM.   We are a very data driven company and focus on pipeline progress and metrics around promptness of sales responses and customer satisfaction.

#### Qualifications

We are looking for someone with 5+ years of demonstrated successful Enterprise Software or SaaS sales experience.  Ideally, you will also have startup experience and enough technical knowledge to understand what developers do and how npm can help them.

#### Location

Our offices are located in downtown Oakland, California, near BART.  This position requires someone who works from our offices most days.

If you are interested, please email us at [hiring@npmjs.com](mailto:hiring@npmjs.com)

## About npm, Inc.

npm is the package manager for JavaScript. The team is small, and growing quickly. If you join us, you will see the company grow through numerous changes, and take a bunch of different roles.

npm’s mission is to take Open Source development to entirely new places. When everyone else is adding force, we work to reduce friction.

npm is not a typical product, and we are not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. We believe that the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We aim for a sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision. Compassion is our strategy.
