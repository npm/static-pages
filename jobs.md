## UX/UI designer

We have a website. It's really big, and quite pretty these days. Under the hood, we rebuilt it completely, launching that new version back in April, when we introduced private modules. But we're just getting started.

[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) gets a million unique visitors every month and over 5MM pageviews, and has grown 200% in the last 12 months. People use it to find new modules, to read the documentation, and now they use it to manage their private modules as well.

In the near future we're going to launch our Organizations feature, and our users will be able to manage teams and package permissions from the website too. Soon after that we're going to be adding a bunch of new features to make it faster and easier to find the right package, by adding [curation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#collections) and [programmatic validation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#ecosystems) of packages, both of which will give us the new data we need to enhance the all-important search experience.

These are chunky, challenging features, and we need somebody to help us design the best experience for our users. npm's philosophy is to reduce friction, so a user experience that is minimal and gets out of their way, with smart defaults and simple, obvious workflows, is what we need.

We know that UX and UI are different skill sets and different jobs, so we know we're asking for a lot when we say we want both, and all other things being equal we will lean towards people who are stronger UX designers, and have good product ideas. If there's more UI work than you can handle, we'll hire contractors to do design and you will be responsible for managing our relationship with them and approving their work.

We are *not* asking you to also be a developer: while you will be part of the engineering organization — because we believe design and engineering should collaborate closely — engineering skills are not a requirement of this job. If you like coding you are welcome to do it, but if you don't you can leave the HTML, CSS and JavaScript to the rest of the engineering team. However, we are a tool for developers, so somebody who understands developers and has worked on technical products before is going to be at an advantage.

This position will be based in our offices in Oakland, CA, and we are not looking for remote candidates for this position.



## engineering manager, www team

[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) is growing quickly, with a million unique visitors every month and over 5MM page views. Having given it a totally new look and overhauled the backend over the last year, we launched [private modules](https://www.npmjs.com/private-modules) in April.

Now we have a ton of ambitious plans for it, including team-management features,  [curation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#collections) and [programmatic validation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#ecosystems) of packages, better stats, and significantly better search. We also have our [npm Enterprise](https://www.npmjs.com/enterprise) product, which needs a web experience all of its own.

All these plans require we grow the www team from its current size of two to five people (plus a full-time designer) in 2015, and grow even further in 2016. That means they need their own manager to keep the team informed, unblocked and happy.

We don't need the engineering manager to be the best engineer on the team -- the skills that make a great team leader are not the same ones that make for a great architect. However, a background in engineering, especially as a leader of teams, will be a big asset. 

We want somebody who is comfortable with the role of a manager as a force multiplier, who gets pleasure in seeing a team work smoothly together and release high-quality software. We want you to care about keeping engineers focused on code, applying just the right amount of process to minimize confusion without adding friction.

You will absolutely need to be a great communicator, good at juggling tasks and priorities. And you'll need to have the kind of big-picture oversight skills to spot tasks and bugs that are slipping through the cracks, and making sure they get tackled before they become a drag on team momentum.

The npm website is [open source](https://github.com/npm/newww), so the output of your team will open to the world, and handling contributions from external developers (people who don't work here regularly fix bugs in our website!) will also be your responsibility.

Because of the amount of face time involved in representing the team, we are not accepting remote applicants for this role. This will be based in our offices in Oakland, CA.



## frontend engineer, www team

[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) is growing quickly, with a million unique visitors every month and over 5MM page views. Having given it a totally new look and overhauled the backend over the last year, we launched [private modules](https://www.npmjs.com/private-modules) in April.

Now we have a ton of ambitious plans for it, including team-management features,  [curation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#collections) and [programmatic validation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#ecosystems) of packages, better stats, and significantly better search. We also have our [npm Enterprise](https://www.npmjs.com/enterprise) product, which needs a web experience all of its own.

All of this adds up to a ton of website that needs to get built, and this role will emphasize front-end skills: robust client-side JavaScript, beautiful CSS, and elegant markup. Our site has only a limited amount of "rich" functionality right now, and you'll be responsible for greatly expanding and improving that, with a lot of say in how it gets built.

We don't need you to be familiar with any specific client-side JS or CSS framework, and in fact we'd prefer the kind of pragmatic, experienced developer who has a bunch of tools in their belt and can thoughtfully select the right one for the job.

The npm website is [open source](https://github.com/npm/newww), so all your work on the main site will be, too.

We have a strong preference for candidates who are local to our offices in Oakland, CA, but we are accepting exceptional remote candidates who have a proven track record of successful remote work.


## architect, www team

[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) is growing quickly, with a million unique visitors every month and over 5MM page views. Having given it a totally new look and overhauled the backend over the last year, we launched [private modules](https://www.npmjs.com/private-modules) in April.

Now we have a ton of ambitious plans for it, including team-management features,  [curation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#collections) and [programmatic validation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#ecosystems) of packages, better stats, and significantly better search. We also have our [npm Enterprise](https://www.npmjs.com/enterprise) product, which needs a web experience all of its own.

To oversee this expansion, we need a senior engineer capable of taking responsibility for the architecture of the site. Somebody who's been in the web space a long time, and has an instinct for the "right way" to build a website rather than "new way" or the "fashionable way".

You won't be managing the team -- that's somebody else's full-time job. Instead you'll be responsible for understanding the full www system and how it integrates with our other systems. You'll be the one making the cost-benefit decisions of different approaches to adding new functionality, and have the final say on all architectural decisions in the www codebase. In the many places where the two systems interact, you'll be collaborating closely with the Registry team's architect.

This is a hands-on coding role. Working with three other full-time www engineers and a designer, you'll be adding features to the www codebase, and spinning up new services to add functionality when necessary.

It's also a leadership role, in that you'll be leading by example. You'll be demonstrating best practices, refactoring older code, and when appropriate, building tooling to smooth the way. You'll review the contributions of other engineers, and share responsiblity for mentoring them. 

We're not looking for a shopping list of languages and technologies. We're looking for people who are smart and get stuff done, who have a track record of understanding complicated problems and solving them.

The npm website is [open source](https://github.com/npm/newww), so all your work on the main site will be, too.

Because this role relies on a great deal of human interaction to coordinate and collaborate with other teams, we are not accepting remote candidates for this role.
