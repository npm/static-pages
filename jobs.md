## CLI engineer

Developers keep finding new ways to use Node, JavaScript, and npm: instead of just being a package manager for Node, npm is a tool in the web developer's toolbox – or a tool to support building out hardware projects – or a tool to help framework developers build out their own ecosystems. The npm command-line interface (CLI) is many developers' primary interface to the JavaScript universe. Your job will be to work with us to make it better.

Developers want npm to be easy to use, flexible enough to solve their problems with web and back-end development, and fast enough to stay out of their way. It's a big open-source project, and npm, Inc. has the good fortune to have not only a team of developers dedicated to maintaining it, but a lively and engaged community of contributors who help with everything, from support and documentation all the way through feature development.

Work on the CLI mostly happens in the open, and working on it is a great way to get paid to work as part of a thriving open-source community. The team [helps contributors get their patches merged](https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/code-review-process) as well as working with the other teams at npm to support the rollout of new features on the registry and web site. There's never a shortage of things to do, but because there's a new CLI release [every week](https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/Release-Process), the emphasis is on steady progress and shipping things when they're ready.

A typical week can include:
* helping users troubleshoot problems with npm in their development environments
* working on new features in the CLI
* reworking the CLI's internals to be easier to understand and maintain
* keeping other projects (Node.js, io.js, ember-cli, Angular) up to date on npm's progress
* walking users through their use cases and requirements and using that to figure out [which problems the CLI needs to tackle next](https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/Roadmap).

It's incredibly rewarding and never boring. Almost every day you'll have an opportunity to make at least one npm user's life better, and improve the product as a whole in the bargain. Software development, release management, product management, developer support and evangelism, community management, and more are all parts of what we do from day to day. As we grow the team, we're looking to add people who want to take ownership of some of these roles, and who are versatile enough to find most of them interesting. npm is only going to get more important to web development over time, and this is a great opportunity to get paid to work on something that's useful to a whole lot of people.


## Support Tech

npm has more than 3 million users worldwide and that number is growing fast. Their use-cases are incredibly diverse: from systems administrators writing automation tools, to hobbyists building robots, to back-end engineers building mobile app APIs, to millions of front-end developers.

And every day, tens of thousands of brand new users show up.

Our mission at npm is to reduce developer friction. We do it by building tools that make JavaScript developers' lives easier, by maintaining a registry with better than 99.999% uptime, and by answering each of the tweets, emails, and GitHub issues that our users send us every day.

npm has been successful because we care about our users.  "npm loves you" is not just marketing; it's a core company value.

To that end, we're building out a dedicated support team.  The right person for this job combines empathy and communication skills with a passion for solving technical problems.  Experience with Open Source and customer service are beneficial, but not required.

Your job will be to serve as the first line of support, fielding common questions, building up FAQs, and solving the unusual or complicated cases yourself, with the help of every member of the engineering team (who are the ones currently doing all these things).

By directly helping our users and customers, and interacting with every member of the team, you'll gain the kind of cross-company insight that is so valuable to a career in technology.  You'll be the first full-time member of this team, but not the last.

You'll report directly to Isaac, CEO and inventor of npm, and a former front-line support tech himself.  You'll be a full employee with all benefits, including competitive salary and stock options.  We are not accepting remote candidates for this role.


## About npm, Inc.

npm is the package manager for JavaScript. The team is small, and growing quickly. If you join us, you will see the company grow through numerous changes, and take a bunch of different roles.

npm’s mission is to take Open Source development to entirely new places. When everyone else is adding force, we work to reduce friction.

npm is not a typical product, and we are not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. We believe that the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We aim for a sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision. Compassion is our strategy.

We offer very competitive salaries, meaningful equity, and generous health, dental and vision benefits. We love it when you represent us at conferences.
